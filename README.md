# Sorting Visualizer Web App

## Demo

## Why?
  - I wanted to create a study tool for computer science students taking their data structure and algorithms courses.
  - I also wanted to gain more experience with some pretty common web development tools. 
  - I was coming fresh off of working on the Travel Itinerary app, and it seemed like it wouldn't be too large of a step.

## What? 
  - React.js and p5.js make up most of the application itself. This may be a naive take on the topic, but the idea was to focus on modularity to allow for quick devtime for new features. 
  - I ended up using TypeScript, this eventually led to someone interesting problems with hosting. I also discovered that Vite doesn't seem to play nice with github's hosting feature.

## Future
  - I would like to come back to this project at some point to implement the original vision in a better way. 
  - The current state only has three implemented sorting algorithms. Theoretically it would be somewhat trivial to implement visualizations for any linear space algorithms.
  - However I am interested in changing the technology used for this project. I have an idea to use HTMX and WASM to allow for more complex algorithms as I was running into issues implemented some of the heavier algorithms in TypeScript.
